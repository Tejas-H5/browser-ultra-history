# Browser ultra-history

This project can be built into a valid Firefox (and possibly chrome) extension that will save every single URL you visit, and every URL visible on that site as well, into a database that you can use to go back to things, or find things URLs that your browser loaded that you may not have had the chance to click on yet. 

## Some situations this would be usefull in 
- This thing happens to me on the YouTube homepage where I see the most amazing video that I want to click on, right after I've already clicked on something else, and when I go back, all the recommended videos are different so I've basically lost that video forever. Wouldn't it be cool if I could just search a history of all links I've seen (and not simply navigated to) ?

Aaaand I can't think of many others. So I've kinda stopped working on this for a bit.
